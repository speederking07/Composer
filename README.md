# Composer AI

A simple generative machine learning algorithm for composing music in MIDI format based on the provided MIDI library. 

## Generative AI

AI is a bit of an overstatement. This approach divides music pieces into a set of consecutive accords. Then it tries to find the next fitting accord with random distribution based on previous history.

## Visualization 

This project comes with a visualization component in the style of falling notes.
